        "summary": "A dormant deep-orbit system has resumed transmission. Unidentified protocols, unauthorised access attempts, and system anomalies have been detected across critical digital infrastructure. In response, Amrita InCTF 2026 has been activated as a national-level operation to recruit, train, and evaluate cyber defence personnel capable of analysing advanced threats, decoding unfamiliar systems, and securing sensitive digital assets under real-world conditions."

    "ClassifiedBrief": {
        "SituationReport": [
            "For over a decade, a deep-orbit system designated ECHO-9 was believed to be inactive. Its purpose undocumented. Its status unknown.",
            "At 02:14 IST, dormant transmission channels resumed activity. Not a beacon. Not a distress signal. A structured transmission—encoded in an unfamiliar protocol.",
            "Within hours, correlated anomalies were detected across multiple layers of critical digital infrastructure: Unauthorised uplink attempts, Altered access rules, Irregular routing behaviour, Command sequences originating outside known control zones.",
            "The source was confirmed: ECHO-9 is active."
        ],
        "ThreatAssessment": [
            "Analysis indicates the transmission is not random. The signal demonstrates intent.",
            "ECHO-9 appears to be interfacing with a critical control system known internally as VAJRA Station—an operational hub responsible for secure communication, navigation systems, and satellite-linked digital assets.",
            "As VAJRA Station begins responding to external inputs, analysts confirm an unprecedented risk scenario: A legacy system in deep orbit is attempting to reassert control over modern digital infrastructure.",
            "If successful, the consequences extend beyond system compromise. This is a loss of command."
        ],
        "OperationalResponse": [
            "In response to this escalation, Operation VAJRA has been activated.",
            "The objective is clear: Decode the unknown transmission protocols, Analyse anomalous system behaviour, Restore command authority, Prevent autonomous hostile control.",
            "This operation requires individuals capable of operating under uncertainty—analysts, problem-solvers, and defenders trained to think beyond predefined rules."
        ],
        "MissionParameters": [
            "Operation VAJRA is not a simulation. It is a controlled, progressive mission environment designed to mirror real-world cyber defence challenges: Incomplete information, Evolving threat conditions, Time-sensitive decision-making, Multi-layered system interactions.",
            "Participants will encounter systems that resist standard approaches and challenges that require adaptive thinking rather than scripted solutions."
        ],
        "CommandAuthority": "Operation VAJRA is executed under the command of Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, in collaboration with team bi0s, one of India’s most respected cyber security research teams. The mission framework draws from years of research, competitive problem design, and real-world security practice, ensuring technical depth and operational realism.",
        "FinalDirective": "ECHO-9 is transmitting. VAJRA Station is responding. Command authority is at risk. Operation VAJRA exists to determine who is capable of restoring control. Only those prepared to analyse, adapt, and defend will progress."
